=================================
01/05/2017

This repository is for the AutoAtten project.

The goal of this project is to allow our attentance machine to automatically
sync with our website in so that attendance data is automatically kept up
to date.

Currently this project is not functional.  It is in development stage, with
a client and a server that can communicate on the same machine.
